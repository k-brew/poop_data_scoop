## Requirements
* test
   * Google account
   * `R`
   * `R` pacakges
      - `pacman` - *package manager*
      - `googledrive` - *for reading data files*

## Getting Started

First make sure you have a Google account (or a specific one you would like to use)


Load packages in console to be used
```{r}
library(pacman) # Package manager (installs and loads)
p_load(googledrive, # Main package
       dplyr, # For cleaning and wrangling
       magrittr) # For pipes
```

Use the `googledrive` package to download file
- future runs will 

```{r}
# Downloading file (set overwrite = F if downloading for first time)
drive_download("scooper_form_responses", type = "csv", overwrite = T)
scooper_df = readr::read_csv("scooper_form_responses.csv")
```
Splitting the auto-generated time stamp into `date` and `time` columns

```{r}
scooper = scooper_df %>%
   tidyr::separate(Timestamp, c("Date", "Time"),
                   sep = " ") # Separating at spacing
```

## Cleaning and wrangling
```{r}
scooper %<>%
   rename("Stool" = "Shit") # Renaming for civility's sake
```

Creating data frame for each dog seperatly
```{r}
GD_scoop = # The 'scoop' on 
```
