## Requirements
* test
   * Google account
   * `R`
   * `R` pacakges
      - `pacman` - *package manager*
      - `googledrive` - *for reading data files*

## Getting Started

First make sure you have a Google account (or a specific one you would like to use)

```{r}
(.packages()) # To check packages

```


Load packages in console to be used
```{r}
library(pacman) # Package manager (installs and loads)
p_load(googledrive, # Main package
       dplyr, # For cleaning and wrangling
       magrittr, # For pipes
       kableExtra, # For making pretty tables
       ggplot2)    # Pretty graphs/visuals
```

Use the `googledrive` package to download file
- future runs will 

```{r cache=TRUE}
# Downloading file (set overwrite = F if downloading for first time)
drive_download("scooper_form_responses", type = "csv", overwrite = T)
scooper_df = readr::read_csv("scooper_form_responses.csv")
```
Splitting the auto-generated time stamp into `date` and `time` columns

```{r}
scooper = scooper_df %>% # To preserve original data frame
   tidyr::separate(Timestamp, c("Date", "Time"),
                   sep = " ") %>% # Separating at column spacing
   rename("Stool" = "Shit") %>% # Renaming for civility's sake
   mutate(both =       # Creating an variable for outings with both dogs
             if_else(`Which Dog?`=="Both", TRUE, FALSE),
          id = row_number())
```

Creating data frame for each dog separately
```{r}
S_scoop = scooper %>% # The 'scoop' on our Great Dane
   group_by(`Which Dog?`) %>%
   filter(`Which Dog?`=="Both"|`Which Dog?`=="Siobhan") %>%
   ungroup() %>%
   select(-c(`Which Dog?`)) # Removing now-irrelevant column

B_scoop = scooper %>% # The 'scoop' on our Wolfhound
   group_by(`Which Dog?`) %>%
   filter(`Which Dog?`=="Both"|`Which Dog?`=="Braonin") %>%
   ungroup()%>%
   select(-c(`Which Dog?`)) # Removing now-irrelevant column
```

First taking a look at the inspiration for this project, a dog whose whining never ceases
```{r}

```

#### AUTOMATIC RETRIVAL OF METRICS


Obtaining most-recent outing statistics for each dog
```{r}
B_last_outing = B_scoop %>% filter(id == (last(B_scoop$id)))
S_last_outing = S_scoop %>% filter(id == (last(S_scoop$id)))

# Condensing down to relevant information to fit within well-formatted table

# Shorter date display
B_last_outing$Date = substr(B_last_outing$Date,1,nchar(B_last_outing$Date)-5)
S_last_outing$Date = substr(S_last_outing$Date,1,nchar(S_last_outing$Date)-5)

# Removing unwanted variables for display
B_last_outing %<>%
   select(-c("Time","Indicator Value","Time-Out","Notes","both"))

S_last_outing %<>%
   select(-c("Time","Indicator Value","Time-Out","Notes","both"))



```


Summary of Last Outing
```{r}
kbl(B_last_outing)
```
